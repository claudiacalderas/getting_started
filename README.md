# getting_started

This week is all about seeing how you are tracking with the content thus far. What we would like to see from you this week:

Create the "Hello World" application the same as you see it in the videos provided in the instructions for the week,

Follow the Command Line, Git, and GitHub process to post your work to GitHub

Submit that URL to your GitHub repo in the assignment submission part of this application (as shown in the videos)

That's it! Pretty straight forward assignment without a ton of complexity in it. But what it shows us is that you have a solid understanding of the work flow of assignments here at Prime. This may have not taken you a lot of time this week, but as I indicated before, understand that this is not a proper representation of time needed to complete assignments the rest of Pre-Study.
